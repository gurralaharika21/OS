== Task 2 ==
This file has the solution for M1 and the description for M2.
Review this solution before you start implementing the M2.
If you don't like our solution for M1 then
tell us why so that we can improve it.

In the M2 you have to write code to handle http requests for static content.
Web servers maintain static content in a directory called document root.
We have provided you with a directory with the name www.
This directory has some html files and images.
A web server may receive a request to access one of these files.

When such a request is received you have to parse the HTTP request
and extract the name of the file in the request aka Uniform Resourse Indicator    
Learn the format of the http requests from the tutorial given below.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_requests.htm

After extracting the URI,
check if the file exists in the document root directory i.e., www

If it exists, you have to read the file contents as the response data.
If not you have to send a 404 file not found response.

Construct the http response by invoking response_headers method
This method is provided in the HTTPServer class
Passing the appropriate response code, content type and length to the method

A tricky part to the response construction is to identify the content type.
Set the content type text/html for files that end with the extension .html

What would be the content type for images? Review the link below.
https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#image

How do we figure out the content subtype of an image?
Explore the use of the library mimetype in python.
